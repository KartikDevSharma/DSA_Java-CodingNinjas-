Please note the following points regarding the usage of this repository:

1. **Solution Updates**: I will be updating this repository as I progress through the course. New solutions will be added, and existing ones may be improved or refined.
2. **Standalone Solutions**: The codes provided here are standalone solutions to the problems. They do not include main methods, data structure initializations, or any other excess code. These solutions are meant to be integrated into your own projects or coding environments.
3. **Running the Code**: The provided solutions may not run by simply copying and pasting the code. You might need to write the main method and other necessary code if you plan to run them in an environment other than Coding Ninjas.

> **Note**: Before jumping onto the solutions, I highly encourage you to try solving the problems yourself first. This will aid in your learning and understanding of the concepts.
